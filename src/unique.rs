/// scope, `*p` will become unreachable for the remainder of the program.
///
/// For example:
/// - [`Box<T>`] implements `DerefMove`, almost by definition.
/// - [`StackBox<T>`] implements `DerefMove`, again by definition.
/// - [`&mut T`] does *not* implement `DerefMove`, because it is
///   necessarilly a borrow of a longer-lived, "trully owning" reference.
/// - [`Rc<T>`] and [`Arc<T>`] do *not* implement `DerefMove`, because even
///   though they own their pointees, they are not the *sole* owners.
/// - [`Pin<P>`] for `P: DerefMove` implements `DerefMove` only when
///   `P::Target: Unpin`, since `DerefMove: DerefMut`.

///
/// Implementing this safe requires that the uniqueness requirement described

/// ```
/// # use moveit::unique::{DerefMove, OuterDrop};
/// fn move_out_of<P>(mut p: P) -> P::Target

///     // destructor.
///     let ptr = &mut p as *mut P;
///     std::mem::forget(p);
///     P::outer_drop(ptr);
///     
///     // Return the moved pointee.
